\\n\\n\\n\\n 최근 모든 분야에서 이전에 없었던 급격한 기술 발전이 사회의 모습을 바꾸고 또 바뀐 사회 필요를 또 다시 새로운 기술로 채워 나가는 빠른 순환이 일어 나고 있다. 그런데 변화를 주도하는 기술 중에서 특히 IT 기술은 더더욱 그런 현상을 가속화 시킬 뿐만 아니라 주도하고 있는 현상을 우리는 쉽게 볼 수 있다. \\n\\n코로나 이후 전 세계적으로 어려운 경제 상황을 보여주고 있지만 상대적으로 유럽은 더더욱 큰 경제 불황의 고리에 빠져들고 있는데 유럽 경제가 힘든 이유는 우크라이나 전쟁을 비롯, 에너지 문제를 포함해서 여러 이유를 함께 생각해 볼 수 있지만 IT산업이 제대로 발전하지 못한 이유도 크게 한 몫하고 있다. 우리가 주변에서 편하게 사용하는 다양한 인터넷 서비스들 중 유럽 것을 찾아보기 힘든 것만 봐도 유럽은 여전히 전통적인 산업에 머물러 있다는 것을 알 수 있다. 또 미국의 S&P 500의 시가 총액 상위 종목들을 보면 애플, Microsoft, 구글, 아마존 그리고 테슬라 등 IT 관련 기술주가 상위권을 휩쓸고 있는 것을 볼 수 있다. 그렇게 우리는 IT 기술이 곧 경쟁력인 세상의 한복판에 살아가고 있다. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe age of Generative AI \\n\\n 작년 말 갑자기 등장한 ChatGPT는 최근 모든 이슈를 가져와도 비교가 되지 않을 만큼 큰 이슈를 일으키고 있다. 사람들은 ChatGPT를 보자마자 IT 역사에 큰 변화를 일으킬 또 하나의 마일스톤이 시작되었다는 생각 보다는 각자 필요한 용도로 활용 할 수 있다는 점에 열광하기 시작했다. 100만 사용자가 단 5일만에 가입한 사실만 보더라도 사람들이 얼마나 ChatGPT에 열광하고 있는 것을 알 수 있다.  \\n\\n <그림1> 주요 서비스의 회원 100만명 달성 시간 (출처: statista)\\n\\n ChatGPT 이전에 세상에서 이슈 몰이를 했던 인공지능으로는 구글의 알파고를 빼놓고 이야기 할 수 없다. 알파고는 바둑을 혹은 바둑만 전문적으로 추론 할 수 있는 인공지능이었다. 최근 알파고 이야기를 주변에서 찾아 볼 수 없는 이유는 알파고를 바둑 이외의 영역에 적용했을 때 인상적인 결과를 만들지 못했기 때문일지도 모른다. 항상 이런 전문성이라는 것은 양날의 검과 같아서 장점과 치명적인 한계를 함께 동반하는 것이 일반적이다. 비슷하게 우리 주변의 인공지능 시스템들은 대부분은 한정된 영역의 일만 할 수 있는 소위 말하는 전문가 시스템이었다. 집안의 온도를 맞추어 주고 공장의 품질 관리를 해주고 농장의 작물들을 키워주는 인공지능 시스템들도 모두 특정 용도에 최적화된 전문가 시스템이라고 할 수 있다. \\n\\n하지만 사람들이 인공지능에 거는 기대치는 이보다 훨씬 높다. 우리가 아이언맨 등의 영화에서 봤던 자비스와 같은 인공지능은 어떨까? 주인공인 토니 스타크가 묻는 질문에 적절하게 대답해주고 주변에 있는 시설들을 제어하면서 주인공의 또 하나의 동료로 완전히 함께 일하는 모습을 볼 수 있다. 사실 자비스와 같이 다양한 용도로 사용 할 수 있는 수준의 인공지능을 인공 일반 지능(AGI: Artificial General Intelligence) 기술이라고 말한다. 인공 일반 지능은 전문가 시스템에 반대되는 개념으로 사람들의 말과 말속의 맥락을 정확하게 이해하고 거기에 맞게 동작하거나 답을 해주는 것이 목표이다. ChatGPT는 이제까지 나왔던 그 어떤 인공 지능 기술 보다도 인공 일반 지능에 가장 가까운 기술이었고 그래서 사람들은 ChatGPT를 보면서 자비스를 떠올리고 있었는지도 모르겠다. \\n\\n\\n\\n전 세계의 말들을 학습한 LLM\\n\\n이전에는 컴퓨터에게 사람의 말을 가르치기 위해서 문법적인 접근을 했다. 언어들의 문법적인 원리를 연구하고 발견된 원리들을 컴퓨터에 소프트웨어로 제작하는 방식으로 접근을 했지만 의미 있는 결과를 도출하는 것이 어려웠다. 문법적인 접근이 어려움을 겪었던 이유는 모든 사람들이 문법적으로 이야기 하지 않는다는 점이 첫 번째 문제였다. 문법이라는 것이 일정한 듯 하면서도 모든 언어적인 현상들을 모두 문법으로 설명할 수 없었다. 또 다른 이유는 사람들은 계속해서 새로운 단어들을 만들어 내고 있다는 점이다. 단적인 예를 들자면 ‘구글링’이라는 단어는 구글이 등장하기 전에는 존재하지 않았던 동사였다. 그래서 문법적인 접근으로는 한계가 있음을 인정하지 않을 수 없었다. 문법적인 접근을 하는 대신 사람들이 실제 사용하는 말을 긁어 모아서 단어 사이의 가중치를 매기는 방식으로 접근하기 시작했다. 이 방식의 경우 사람들의 말의 양을 늘리면 늘릴 수록 결과물도 함께 좋아지는 장점이 있었고 또 인터넷 등에서 사람들이 실제로 사용하는 말을 모아서 학습하다 보니 새로운 단어들과 기존에 알려진 문법과 상관없는 현상들을 모두 분석할 수 있는 장점이 있었다. 문제는 말의 양을 늘리면 늘릴 수록 분석하는데 들어가는 컴퓨팅 비용도 기하급수적으로 늘어난다는 점에 있었다. 그래서 무한정으로 학습량을 늘리는 것은 어려웠다. 어찌되었든 이렇게 사람의 말을 학습해 놓은 것을 언어 모델(LM: Language Model)이라 부르는데 이 중에서도 특히 언어 모델을 엄청난 크기로 만들어 놓은 것을 거대 언어 모델(LLM: Large Language Model)이라고 불렀다. \\n\\n\\n\\n데이터세트\\n\\n토큰\\n\\n교육 비율\\n\\n일반 크롤링\\n\\n4100억개\\n\\n60%\\n\\n웹텍스트 2\\n\\n190억개\\n\\n22%\\n\\n책1\\n\\n120억개\\n\\n8%\\n\\n책2\\n\\n550억개\\n\\n8%\\n\\n위키백과\\n\\n30억개\\n\\n3%\\n\\n <표1> 대표적인 LLM인 GPT3의 학습에 사용된 데이터 양\\n\\n거대 언어 모델을 만드는 데에는 엄청난 비용과 컴퓨팅 인프라가 필요한 까닭에 주요 소프트웨어 회사에서 개발하고 있다. 최근에는 주로 구글, Microsoft, 엔비디아, 그리고 오픈AI와 같은 글로벌 대형 업체들이 주도적으로 연구와 개발을 하고 있는데 이중에서도 오픈AI는 상대적으로 작은 규모의 회사이긴 하지만 Microsoft가 14조가 넘는 비용을 투자하면서 선두로 나서게 되었으며 언어 모델인 GPT, 이미지를 생성하는 DALL-E2 이외에도 많은 연구를 하고 있다. \\n\\n\\n\\n지식전이 현상의 발견 \\n\\n거대 언어 모델을 만드는 과정에서 수 많은 말들을 처리하다 보니 잘 만들어진 언어 모델은 그 자체로 많은 잠재성을 가질 수 있게 되었다. 언어 모델에 들어 있는 말들 자체가 하나의 거대한 지식 체계로 동작하면서 새로운 능력들이 발현하게 되었는데 이와 같은 현상을 지식의 전이(Knowledge Transfer)라 부르게 되었다. 실제로 오픈AI가 만든 GPT-3 모델의 경우 기본적으로 감정의 분석, 문서의 요약, 번역, 질의응답, 작문, 문장의 재구성 등 많은 능력을 가지고 있어서 이미 많은 분야에서 이 능력을 활용하고 있거나 활용하기 위해서 시도하고 있다. GPT-4의 경우 이 보다 훨씬 더 큰 잠재력이 있는 것으로 알려져 있다. 지식의 전이 현상으로 인해 다양한 일들을 척척 해내는 것을 보면 거대 언어 모델의 능력이 무한 할 것 같지만 ChatGPT 역시 만능은 아니다. ChatGPT가 나름 다양한 능력을 가지고 있고 이전에 없었던 새로운 일들을 가능하게 해주는 놀라운 존재이긴 하지만 한계도 역시 분명하다. ChatGPT는 다음과 같이 알려진 한계가 있다. \\n\\n\\n\\n2021년 9월에 멈춘 학습\\n\\n일관성 없는 결과물\\n\\n거짓 정보 (Hallucination)\\n\\n영어에 비해 떨어지는 한국어 결과물\\n\\n\\n\\nChatGPT를 학습 시킬 때 전세계의 인터넷과 책에 있는 자료들을 긁어 모아서 학습을 시켰지만 그 학습 자료는 2021년 9월에 머물러 있다. 따라서 최신 정보를 묻는다면 대답을 할 수 없다. 가령 예를 들자면 \\n\\n\\n\\n‘지금 한국의 대통령은?’, \\n\\n‘오늘 삼성전자 주가는 얼마야?’,\\n\\n’내일 비가 올 것 같아?’')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader\n","\n","loader = CSVLoader(\"/content/titanic3.csv\",\n","                   csv_args={\n","                       'delimiter': ',',\n","                       'quotechar': '\"',\n","                       'fieldnames': ['Pclass', 'Survived', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin', 'Embarked', 'Boat', 'Body', 'Home.dest']\n","                   })\n","\n","data = loader.load()\n","data[:10]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6masXS4yhcNR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738716102376,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":407,"user":{"displayName":"이한슬/AI·소프트웨어학부(소프트웨어전공)","userId":"06997898265828508065"}},"outputId":"1eabcf35-c480-44e3-9928-b2435d4805b2"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[Document(metadata={'source': '/content/titanic3.csv', 'row': 0}, page_content='Pclass: \\ufeffpclass\\nSurvived: survived\\nName: name\\nSex: sex\\nAge: age\\nSibSp: sibsp\\nParch: parch\\nTicket: ticket\\nFare: fare\\nCabin: cabin\\nEmbarked: embarked\\nBoat: boat\\nBody: body\\nHome.dest: home.dest'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/titanic3.csv', 'row': 1}, page_content='Pclass: 1\\nSurvived: 1\\nName: Allen, Miss.

Famer Shannon sharp ran windhorse and Stephen A in La my goodness gentlemen how we feeling great ready to roll all right let's Dive Right In so the trade that's good I feel real good yeah you feeling good okay Luca donic for Anthony Davis the 25-year-old donic arrived in Los Angeles last night and met with Lakers Jam Rob pinka LeBron James intends to stay with the Lakers Beyond Thursday's NBA trade deadline of source familiar with his plans confirmed to ESPN all right out of the gate guys I just want your reaction Stephen A when you first heard this oh I was shocked um I was shocked because I couldn't believe that any franchise it's it's it's a big it's the biggest shock that I've ever seen cover in the NBA all of these years guys Lucas 25 years old he averaged 34 last year he's career 28 point per game scorer universally recognized as one of the top five players in the world not to mention being from Slovenia he he has Global appeal he is an iconic international basketball brand which explains on the Lakers side that's an easy one they got their succession plan in place you've secured the biggest one of the biggest stars for the next decade so this is what the Lakers do because their primary source of income is their basketball franchise OB obviously he not one of them owners that got you know this is a side gig this is it so this is what the Lakers do and they always secure a big time star in the case of the Dallas Mavericks to have that star in your possession and for him to be gone just left me with a raised eyebrow you're hearing a lot of things about conditioning lack of dedication the fact that it became much of a headache for them very very frustrating he scheduled to come back February 8th Shannon uh from his calf injury and then you know then they're telling folks well you know what that's really not up to us it's up to his team and when you think about orchestrating a champ or you know just assembling a championship Squad they felt despite his greatness he was an impediment to that as opposed to you know being something that was a contributor to that again is one of the top five players on the planet and you're shocked by that so I looked at it from that standpoint and I said there is so much more to this that we don't know there is so much more of this that speaks to their level of frustration and dare I say potential Fury no matter what they say no matter what they try to I Shannon Do You Realize by sending Luca to Los Angeles he is no longer eligible for the super Max theyve cost him over $100 million by trading him from Dallas to LA and didn't care in the end you take all of that into consideration there's so much more to this story Kyrie the ball's going to be in his hands him and Anthony Davis is going to be the cornerstones offensively you get all of that stuff LeBron James what's he gonna do even though everybody saying he's staying some people saying he should wave his no trade clause go to go to state New York we'll get into all of that later but this move to see somebody of Lucas caliber be traded like this not to be told even his agent Bill Duffy didn't know who's a veteran one of the great great agents this business has ever known he didn't know Luca didn't know um you don't see that happening very often it's definitely a change in the landscape owners are loving this is sending the right kind of message in their eyes we're the ones in control not them all of that comes into play with this one move it was a statement being made uh as far as I'm concerned not just by the Dallas Mavericks but by the league and I think the Fallout is going to be dramatic to say the least absolutely I think this is two absolutely fascinating things one on the Dallas side they had Luca donic under what they say in the league under control okay he had qualified for the super max that meant that this summer they were going to sign him to a 5-year extension the ability to lock down a player in his mid-20s who's one of the greatest players in the league on a 5-year extension is the dream for franchises that's what the the Thunder can do with Shay gilders Alexander this summer they're and I'm telling you on June 30th Oklahoma State Troopers are going to be there to escort the piece of paper into this house so that the paper doesn't blow away in the wind to make sure that they sign it that's how amazing it is and the and the Mavericks looked at that and said you know what we don't think he's worth 350 million we can't stomach even giving it to him so that's one unbelievable situation with a 25-year-old guy who's been a five-time first team all NBA player I just want to point something out Steph Curry hasn't made first team all NBA five times this guy's 25 he's already done that okay then you have the Lakers side they just hit a grand slam all right they were not going anywhere this year they may have gotten you know hot at the right time and healthy at the right time and LeBron and AD played great at the right time and they may have gotten to the second round of the playoffs but this team had a ceiling on it which is one of the reasons why there was such you know hope that they could use their draft their trade assets to somehow get a player like this they had now not only are able to make a an incredible value trade that's right I just said they traded Anthony Davis who is going to be a first ballot Hall of Famer and it was a value trade because they got incredible value for him because they get a 25 old who is not even in his prime yet who has the potential to be a dominant player for the next decade and then they Stephen A get to sign him to that five-year contract this summer and they get to do it at a $100 million discount that they wouldn't have to play if he was on the supermax now a lot of how this is going to work is going to depend on what the Lakers do going forward from here because they have to use what they still have and build a team around him they've got incredibly important decisions to make going forward they've got to get the out of Luca which the Mavericks apparently didn't think they could do but those two things happening in the same uh moment were incredible in the history of the league Stephen A you I was I was shocked Stephen A and I was texting because the Lakers had just beaten the Knicks and so I was going Stephen A and I was going back and forth he he s Ino I'm s inois and then I'm like WTF is this real because the last time Shams really sent something out it was the Kawai and I thought he was hacked again so I'm like ain't no way there's no possible way that the Dallas Mavericks are trading a 25y old because we've never seen a 25y old unless he was has requested said I'm not resigning and they move him to get assets but to say no we don't need your request we're moving on and guys I hate getting in conjecture I hate getting into speculation Inu Endo but the first I'm like what must have Luca done this is what Nico Harrison said I just say there's levels to it there are people that fit the culture and there's people that come in and add to the culture and those are two distinct things I believe the people that are coming in are adding to the culture anytime I hear that word culture guys my ears perk up my ears perked up about two years ago where Rick Carlile would not sign an extension Stephen A as long as you've covered this league and been around it when do you the same thing when does a coach has a generational talent and he refuses to sign an extension now we've seen those guys get fired but to not sign an extension when you got a Luca when you got a LeBron when you got a l bird or magic that doesn't happen and so there's a lot more to this than meets the eye but it seems to me the marage were haded up to here and whatever here is is it here is it here but they had had enough of Luca and they didn't believe we don't trust you now and you're making 40 if we give you 70 there's no possible way we can control you you know one of the things that you know do in in just talking to so many people I remember I decided to just revisit Nico Harrison's resumee and this man played basketball at West Point Military discipline that kind of thing been an executive at Nike for 19 years who has he worked with Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant LeBron James Jason kid Etc you saw that and what are the what do we Rave about whether they win they won give it a week they win a championship they win a week they win and a week later you know what what are we doing what are we doing to prepare for next year if they lost they ain't even wait a week you know somebody like Kobe shoots air balls as a rookie for crying out loud gets off the team plane after landing back in Los Angeles and goes straight to the gym family looking for for him and everything like that because he's in the gym shooting baskets because of all the baskets he had missed and that put in with the air balls with Utah and then we know what his career ultimately are materialized into they weren't saying those kind of things about Luca instead they were saying he was listed at 230 and he was coming in the camp at 260 30 pounds overweight out of shape not committed Etc how much truth there is to that one with surise maybe it was embellished to some degree but when you look at this clearly it wasn't embellished in their eyes they meant it for them to move away from a guy that is an international basketball Superstar International you understand the world over and to let him walk out the door at age 25 when a Bad season for him is averaging more than 25 a game okay to let that man walk away like that there has to be so much more to how much how bad things were between him and the Mavericks organization and then they don't usually like if they got if they got love for you or whatever they're going to let your agent know they going to they going to tip you off what they're not going to do is cost you over aund million doll they don't do that to people unless you're just somebody they have no use for and they're not going to say it like that but clearly that's what the Dallas Mavericks were feeling to make this kind of move knowing the kind of detrimental effect it could have on Luca donic at least for the immediate moment we know he'll make the money up he is who he is but I'm just saying for the immedi moment they're sending a message goad Wendy you're absolutely right and remember Rudy Gober went for four first round picks they got Anthony Davidson won not the 2027 not Davis got the 2031 not a pick swap they say no we good Stephen A I've said this a lot and you've heard me say it people will tolerate you until they can replace you I don't care who do you think you are you can go to the job place you can go in professional Sports as soon as they can replace you they will especially if you got questionable Behavior this tell this tells you a lot because the fact that they didn't shop him when they could have got a morgage borgs a pck think about what Shay Gil what what Oklahoma got for Shay gilges when when the when the uh uh Clippers traded him think about what they got for him Luca five consecutive first teams all pro I mean all NBA selection he's 25 that tell like I said I started my ears started perking up when Carlile wouldn't resign and you start hearing this little murmuring and here and there man there's so much going on but you're right Stephen A the Maverick says we're tired we're tired of this because we don't believe if we give you 69 a year it's going to get any better because sometimes you and maybe a change of scenery is what Luca needs maybe he'll get it now like damn I just lost $116 million just like that maybe that's what he needs but they felt in Dallas him making 40 plus million it wasn't going to get any better if we gave him 69 because then we absolutely could not control him cuz he get to the first or the second year of that deal and normally money doesn't change it makes you more of what you already are so if you're disciplined hard-headed it's going to make you worse because you're going to become emboldened by said power of money I'm shocked that this happened but it says a lot about how the organization felt about Luca donic at this time I'm so glad Stephen you brought up Nico Harrison resume because there's a couple of things on this resume that I think are fascinating one is that he's worked with Rob pinka for 20 years when Rob pinka brought Kobe Bryant as a young agent from Adidas to Nike the point person on the recruitment was a young executive of Nike and niiko Harrison this is these are guys who have done big important deals with important highlevel players for two decades the second thing is I want to talk about two things that niiko Harrison has done as the general manager of the Mavericks number one he traded for Kyrie Irving he for kyri Irving at a time where his value was very low I thought it was a mistake I told him so we were across the street for LeBron breaking Kareem or Kem Abdul Jabar scoring record Nico had come in because he had such a relationship with LeBron and I said I think he made a bad mistake there and I had to apologize to him last year because I said you know what it was a really shrewd move he took a risk knowing the personalities knowing the team knowing what his team needed and it paid off Stephen he also wouldn't pay Jaylen Brunson he could have given him an extension when he did they viewed him kind of of as a not as not as a superstar or even a star they kind of valed him as a high level backup they didn't extend him they were looking for other things so I would say this and by the way everybody has pluses and minuses so here's the thing guys is this going to be a Jaylen Brunson where it's a huge whiff or is this going to be a Kyrie Irving where it's a gigantic hit it only matters in the whole history of the Mavericks franchise yeah well if the issue is him staying ready and getting in shape no one better to learn from than LeBron James even though I don't really understand how they're going to work on the court together in terms of fit which we'll get into in just a bit first call first of all this this they received a call about two weeks ago from Nico Harrison and obviously Nico and Rob pinka go back a very very long ways all right so they have that relationship and that communication outside of them the only people who knew were the owners okay once you get to that point what does that mean what that means is that LeBron James didn't know Anthony Davis Didn't Know Rich Paul didn't know Bill Duffy didn't know Luca donic did not no okay and you could see by the shot Anthony Davis just closed on the $32 million mansion in Belair you got to put that on the market now unless he wants to keep it and go to end off season Luca donic just closed on the12 million house in in in in Dallas okay which is nothing I'm sure it's very nice I'm sure it's very nice okay but the bottom line is this they were planting their Roots they didn't see this coming and for LeBron not to see this coming it's a very very big deal now there's a lot of people out there that's going to throw clutch Sports clutch Sports into into the mix because they're going to say Lakers want to send a message you know clutch Sports isn't running things we're running things etc etc and fairness to clutch Sports is very important when you lost when you listen to the Lakers they'll tell you the conversations were very very respectful this is our organization this is what we felt was in the best interest of the organization Rich Paul Anthony Davis all of those guys took it like professionals and they deserve credit for that but it doesn't negate the fact that that that narrative has been out there for quite some time about the Lakers and clutch Sports and specifically LeBron James this year again his son is on the team the Lakers forget LeBron James forget bronny James forget the rest of the league the Lakers felt like hey we've done a lot we we've capitulated we've acquiesced we know what a superstar he is and we do we'll do anything for our stars and that's how they believe they treated LeBron James so if that was the way they treated LeBron James and that's the way they've treated all of their Stars how do you explain this happening and let's take it let's let's let's bring it home God Rest the soul if Kobe Bryant was alive would you have done something like this without letting Kobe Bryant no I think we all know the answer to that question not a million damn years it wouldn't have happened he would have known so if LeBron James truly did not know anything that does leave that does give you cause the pause and make you wonder make you wonder about what kind of message are they sending because Luca is clearly the future Lebron is not the future he's 40 years of age he the 22nd season he'll probably play he's definitely going to play his 23rd season we know how phenomenal and how great he is and how he's revered and and he should be but for them to make this move and him not know anything about it they can say hey we want to make sure it didn't get out because the slightest thing could get in the way with it they could say all of that till the cows come home in the end when you have an ideal relationship with a star of that that magnitude he knows something and they're saying they knew nothing and if they knew nothing that does make you look at the Lakers and and think about how are they feeling about him right now can I ask your question Stephen A you would know with Jerry Krauss running trades by Michael Jordan no but that was different Shannon uh Jerry Krauss alienated Michael Jordan from his second year in the league Michael Jordan you know what I'm saying they didn't like him you they he he dealt with them but Michael Jordan was not fond and everybody knows that story Shannon so that's a different situation I think the thing is Kobe was homegrown where you can never go to a place and they love you like where you left he Leon was revered in Miami but Miami didn't love him like Cleveland because he was there as original he goes to LA but La is never going to love him like they Cleveland loved him because he's original and he's never going to get the love and the Adoration that Kobe got because because they saw Kobe come in as a 17y old kid and leave as a married grown man with kids so I I'm not surprised by this uh and you're right my grandfathered to say boy two people can keep a secret but one of them needs to be dead in order for this a trade of this magnitude and not a whiff not a hint no Aroma of this could potentially happen is baffling I've never seen a trade of this size in any sport that at some point in time Stephen A we didn't even get a a hint of it Stephen A we didn't hear nothing Anthony Davis had just came out and said hey we get another big we playing well LeBron is still LeBron yada y y and there are reports that said hey we didn't feel he was going to be he could be a onea and so forth and so on but I just look at it I think it's just that look I like what the Lakers did because LeBron is G he's closer to the end than the beginning this is what the Lakers do check the history they got wil they got Kareem they got Shaq they got LeBron in order for you to survive in the lake at the Lakers you got to have a superstar and I'm not not talking about any Superstar I'm talking about generational Global Superstar and that's what they've got Midway through LeBron's rookie year in 2004 right after he turned 19 years old the Cav sat down with them and said going forward we're going to talk to you about all of our deals from that moment until this trade 21 years LeBron was always involved even in Miami he may not have been able to direct what they were doing he did didn't learn stuff the moment it happened this is a huge moment because it basically signals the end of the LeBron James as the centerpiece era in LA and the beginning of the Luca donic era and now every decision going forward who they may sign who they may trade for how they operate their team is going to be built around number 77 not around number 23 that had to happen it's not controversial and in a way they kind of did LeBron a bit of a favor by not coming to him and the reason I say that is because they didn't want to put on his plate your your your friend your Co your coworker the guy you won a championship with your teammate at clutch Sports they didn't want to put that on his plate they took it off of his plate and so this is something that needed to happen right it was going to be difficult I thought for the Lakers instead it's a beautiful situation where they can transition to a star so I have no issue with this and LeBron's first move Stephen A is to say I'm not going to look for a trade well listen here's the deal you're not saying any of this to point a finger at Le LeBron James in the negative you're just talking about the reality just like Shannon just articulated there's a reality that comes along with all of this okay for example when we bring up Nico Harrison well he doesn't just have a long-standing relationship with with with Rob palinka he has a long-standing relationship with jeie bus because of the connection to Kobe let's remember that that's number one number two the most important thing and the reason why we bring LeBron James up and what he didn't know is because people have speculated about the end of LeBron but it's really been about him he goes up gives it to my Nicks at Madison Square Garden Saturday night which is what Shannon was texting me about I knew I was going to hear from I want to hide from him after I was there and watched John Morant do nothing that game you know the Stars usually show up to Madison Square Garden that particular night was not John morant's night but he'll have many more but LeBron James showed up and showed out with family and friends and attendance just to rub it in even okay and to know his greatness and to know what he brings to the table there is no getting around this the Los Angeles lak has made a statement we're moving forward we appreciate what you've done but this is no longer your franchise this is Luca Don's franchise now you can go out there and do what you want for the next year or so but this is no longer yours no one has ever said that in the 22 years that LeBron James has been in the NB a and no one has ever said that to him not Cleveland not Miami not Cleveland again not Los Angeles not even the league it's been his and the Los Angeles Lakers with this move said we appreciate you we don't mind you sticking around if you want to leave leave if you want to stay we're happy to keep you but this is this man's franchise now and his name is Luca Don [Music]
